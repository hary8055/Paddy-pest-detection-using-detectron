# Paddy-pest-detection-using-detectron
This project applies deep learning and computer vision techniques to accurately **segment insects in paddy field images** using the **Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask-RCNN)** framework. It aims to enhance pest detection and enable efficient pest control through early and accurate insect identification.
